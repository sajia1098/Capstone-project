# world assumptions - 
Users can access the internet and suitable devices (e.g., computers, smartphones).
Users are students of FSC with a valid RAM id.
Users want to sell and buy outfits of different fashion types. 
# user requirements -
user profile w bio profile pic and posts
Green white and black colors repping FSC
Pinterest layout where pictures of outfits will be layout in rows
DM feature between customers and vendors 
Social media likes and comments on posts???
A search feature and different categories (like sustainable clothes since FSC is big on that)
# specifications (and interface needs)
User authentication 
Clean and eye-catching shopping UI
Optimization of responsiveness 
Toolbar for navigation 
Secure payment methods (will this be integrated in or will the users DM each other to send their venmos or pay cash in person on campus?)
# program and hardware
Most likely using Firebase for user database
Using Java and its frameworks
Scene builder (donâ€™t know how to get real users to use it through this)
Maybe integrating it to IOS or Android (still Java) or use react/node.js for website integration or another API for that
